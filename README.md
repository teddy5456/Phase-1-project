# Tâ€™s Movie Database

This is a website where one can find information about movies. Whether old or new, it is extensive enough.

## MVP

The website consists of:

**Search Bar**- This is a bar on top of the website where one enters input and searches for it.

**Search Button**- It is a clickable button next to the search bar that tells the computer that the text that the user has entered in the search bar is ready for execution.

**The results container**- After the user searches for a movie in the search bar and the website fetches it in the API the movies that contain the word in the search bar are displayed. In the results container, there is a position for the movie poster, movie title and other information.

Each result has a **more info** button which leads to a popup modal that holds the description of the movie.

## User Story

As a user one can find movies with the name or are close to the title.

As a user i can press the button within the results and it will take me to the description.

### Credits

All the information from the searches are gotten from the **TMDB(The movie Database )API.**

Everything else is created by me, the author, Teddy Wambua. Access to the website is controlled by me.
